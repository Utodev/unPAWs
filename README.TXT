  UNPAWS
  ------

  TARGET

      UnPAWS takes snapshot files (.SNA, .SP, .Z80) of  Spectrum  games written  with PAWS or Quill system (version A or C), and  produces  text listings of the game database.

  PLATFORM
    
  The code  has been  compiled  with Borland Pascal 7.0  (MS-DOS executable) and Delphi 5.5 (Win32 executable). It may probably be compiled easily using Freepascal currently.

  Update: on April 2016 it has been compiled with free pascal (fpc 2.6.4) for Windows without any problem.

  INPUT

     The input must be any spectrum game made  with PAWS, in any  of this file formats:

    - .SP  (Pedro Gimeno's Spectrum Emulator)
    - .SNA (JPP Emulator)
    - .Z80 (Lunter's Z80 Emulator)

  USE

     Just  type  UNPAWS  in  the  command line to know about the syntax.
